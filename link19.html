Freiwilliges soziales Jahr (Voluntary social year), abbr. FSJ, is a state-funded voluntary work program particularly for young adults. It can last between six to eighteen months and also be spent working abroad. Before compulsory military or civilian service was abandoned in Germany, the FSJ could be used as a replacement if the service duration was at least twelve months.<br><br>

“海上学府” （Institute for Shipboard Education）由香港董浩云在上世纪70年代创立，各国大学生乘坐董先生捐赠的“环球探险家号”，环航世界，边学习，边考察。由于学费昂贵，中国只有几名学生在上世纪70年代末受到董氏航海基金会的资助，参加了“海上学府”的游学。<br><br>

汕头大学是中国大陆唯一一所参加 “海上学府”环球游学项目的高校。2003年起，美国匹兹堡大学连续10年每年为汕大提供两个名额，参加为期3―4个月的“海上学府”学习。汕头大学商学院2000级学生陈冰琳是第一位“海上学府”的幸运儿。4个月四门课程(International  Business，Writing，Global Study，History)都拿了“A”，获得了美国导师很高的评价。<br><br>

海上学府环球航线怎样走？<br><br>

虽然每一年环球航线略有不同，但均跨越大西洋、印度洋和太平洋，抵达东、西、南、北半球，沿途停靠十多个国家，靠岸时间从一天到一周不等。何洋此次游学将经停12个国家的16个地区，海上航行105天。她将从巴哈马拿骚出发，前往多米尼克罗索、巴西马瑙斯、加纳塔科拉迪及阿克拉、南非开普敦、毛里求斯路易港、印度柯钦、新加坡、越南胡志明市、中国香港及上海、日本神户及横滨、美国夏威夷希罗，最后回到美国加州圣地亚哥。<br><br>

参加这个项目要花多少钱？<br><br>

海上学府项目春、秋两次航行的学费，从2.3万美元到3.1万美元不等。何洋此次虽然申请到2万多美元的奖学金，但由于游轮要经停12个国家，因而她另外准备了折合人民币5万多元的备用金。<br><br>

何洋介绍，申请海上学府项目与申请出国留学的过程类似。近年来，在中国大陆只有复旦大学、汕头大学与海上学府项目有合作交流。若要个人申请，则需通过官方网站，进行全英文入学申请。<br><br>

Students attend classes while the ship is at sea in a variety of subjects and disciplines. These classes are typically humanities classes connecting with one or more of the countries on the itinerary. All students are required to take Global Studies, an interdisciplinary core course; When the ship is in a port, no classes are held. Students are then able to travel on Semester at Sea sponsored trips or independently within the country. However, travel outside the country of port is strictly prohibited, resulting in dismissal from the program.<br><br>

Although the University of Virginia is the academic sponsor for the program, Semester at Sea is open to students from any university. <br><br>

Semester at Sea (SAS) is a study abroad program founded in 1963, now managed by the Institute for Shipboard Education in Charlottesville, Virginia. The University of Virginia is the current academic sponsor for the program while the program itself is run on a cruise ship called the MV Explorer. Throughout the history of the program, nearly 55,000 undergraduate students from more than 1,500 colleges and universities have participated in Semester at Sea.<br><br>

During the spring and fall semesters, the approximately 100-day program circumnavigates the globe, with up to 720 undergraduates traveling from North America heading either east across the Atlantic or west across the Pacific, visiting from 8 to 11 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and South America, before ending the voyage in another North American port. The program previously had voyages that would sail through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal, but due to piracy concerns in the Gulf of Aden, voyages now typically travel around Africa. During the summer months, ISE hosts a shorter 65-day Semester at Sea program that concentrates on one general region of the world. Frequently, summer semester programs visit various ports in East Asia or Europe. In May 2011, Semester at Sea introduced a new short-term or Maymester voyage with a curriculum focused on the UN Millennium Development Goals. These voyages lasted 26 days and offered students the opportunity to earn 4-5 transferable credits. However, following the Maymester 2012 voyage, Semester at Sea made the decision to cancel Short-Term voyages indefinitely due to low enrollment.<br><br>

Additionally, a two-week "Enrichment Voyage" program is held for continuing education participants during December and January. Itineraries for these voyages focus on Central America and South America, often transiting the Panama Canal or traveling up the Amazon River.<br><br>
	
The History of Shipboard Education<br><br>

Nearly 100 years ago, the idea for a floating university that would travel the world became the passionate pursuit of James Edwin Lough, a psychology professor at New York University. He believed changes needed to be made to traditional teaching methods of American universities and soon became a leader in a new educational movement. Travel and first-hand experience, he felt, must be part of every scholar’s education and he set out to find others who shared this vision.<br><br>

The University of Virginia is a public research university in Charlottesville, Virginia, United States. It was conceived and designed by U.S. President Thomas Jefferson, and established in 1819. <br><br>

In the 2013 edition of U.S. News & World Report's National University Rankings, the school was listed as America's 2nd best public university, tied with UCLA and surpassed only by UC Berkeley.<br><br>


<a href= "link20.html">欧洲宗室源流简史</a><br><br>

Semester at Sea was originally named University of the Seven Seas and later World Campus Afloat before gaining its present name in 1977. In December 2005, it was announced that the University of Virginia would begin academic sponsorship of the program in Summer 2006. Previous sponsors include the University of Pittsburgh (1981C2006), the University of Colorado (1977C1980), and Chapman University (1965C1975).<br><br>

The Spring 2012 Voyage<br><br>
This semester’s 570 students disembarked this week in San Diego, heading out towards their futures with an international and interconnected outlook on life. The 108th voyage of Semester at Sea has officially come to an end after 105 days, 12 countries, and 25,000 nautical miles around the world.<br><br>

The MV Explorer pulled away from Nassau in January and headed eastbound to the West Coast, touching 4 continents on the way. Students took classes in anthropology, art history, biology, business, economics, English, geography, history, linguistics, media studies, medicine, music, poetry, political science, religious studies, studio art, writingCand that’s just the courses covered on the blog.<br><br>

From the opera house in Manaus to hip-hop concerts in Cape Town, the tunnels of Viet Nam to the skyscrapers of Hong Kong, non-profits in Cambodia to orphanages in Brazil, grade schools in India to universities in Singapore, soccer in South Africa to cycling in Accra, snorkeling in Dominica, tea ceremonies in Japan, visits from foreign officers and domestic dignitaries, and home stays in India and Ghana, this has truly been, in the words of this semester’s executive dean Dr. Bob Vieira, “an epic voyage.”<br><br>

Gap year<br><br>
间隔年（Gap Year），一般指青年在升学之后开学之前、或者毕业之后工作之前，所做的一次长期旅行。<br><br>
Gap year的起源，就一定得从上世纪六十年代的嬉皮士浪潮说起。当时不约而同前往印度的英国嬉皮士们正是最初意义上的gap year实践者。六十年代的西方社会在政治、经济和文化各方面都经历了前所未有的巨大震荡。反越战示威、美国总统肯尼迪遭暗杀、反种族运动、伦敦的前卫时装风潮…各种新思潮和新事物的冲击促成了the swinging sixties的产生。在这股风潮下，活跃于四、五十时代的“垮掉的一代”开始演变为更加活跃的反主流文化群体DD嬉皮士。他们用公社式的和流浪的生活方式来表达对越战和民族主义的反对，提倡非传统的宗教文化，批评西方国家中产阶级的价值观。典型的嬉皮士之旅一般是从西欧出发，以最便宜的旅行方式穿过欧亚大陆到达亚洲的印度或斯里兰卡。如今鼎鼎大名的背包族旅行指南《Lonely Planet》的创始人Tony Wheeler夫妇就是在这样的旅行之后写出了第一本书《便宜走亚洲》。 嬉皮士hippie之旅自有其精神上的驱动力，一般是“认识自我”，“寻找精神家园”或是“与他人交流”。<br><br>




A gap year is time out to travel between life stages. It is also known as a sabbatical, time off, time out and a year out, referring to a period of time (not necessarily 12 months) in which people disengage from curricular education and/or work and undertake activities such as traveling, volunteering or working abroad.<br><br>

In the field of college applications, a gap-year is a year taken between high school and college. During this gap-year, students engage in extra-academic and non-academic courses, language studies, volunteer work, travel, internships, sports and more, all for the purpose of improving themselves and their resumes before going to college. These academic gap-years are also called Pathways, Prep-Year and Bridge-Year.<br><br>


The practice of taking time out developed in the United Kingdom in the 1960s. During this time, a student might travel, engage in volunteer work overseas or undertake a working holiday abroad.<br><br>

In 1967, Nicholas Maclean-Bristol set up the educational volunteering charity Project Trust and sent three volunteers to Addis Ababa in Ethiopia.<br><br>

In 1973, Graham "Skroo" Turner set up the company Topdeck, one of the first tour operators.<br><br>

In 1978, the Prince of Wales and Colonel John Blashford-Snell began what is now known as Raleigh International by launching Operation Drake, an expedition voyage around the world following Sir Francis Drake's route.<br><br>

In the United States, the deferred year idea was promoted by Cornelius H. Bull, in 1980.<br><br>

In 2010, a deferred year increased among school, college and university leavers, as this is seen as an attractive option for future career development.[3] Conversely, 2011 saw a decline in the number of prospective students from the UK taking gap years due to the competitiveness of courses and the imminent rise in university fees.<br><br>

A year out has grown very popular among students in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. A trend for a year out is to travel, volunteer and working abroad, which may include participating in international education programs that combine language study, homestays, cultural immersion, community service, and independent study.<br><br>
McNerney：Help others get better. 政工/政委/Vujicic<br><br>

I start with people's growth, my own growth included. Help others get better, that is, help people who work for you grow. If team works, everything will be fine.<br><br>
My ability to lead (leiten/Leiter), to chart the course for the team members, to inspire them to reach for performance, to deliver the values you bring to the job. We focus on the courage to do the right thing. I tend to think about this in terms of helping others get better. I view myself as a value-added facilitator（促进者/帮助着）here more than as someone who's crashing through the waves on the bridge of a frigate护卫舰. It feels great to see the people you work with grow and achieve.<br><br>
It generally gets down to a very personal level - openness to change, courage to change, hard work and teamwork. What I do is figure out how to unlock that in people, because most people have that inside them. But they often get trapped in, for example, fear, bureaucracy or confusion.<br><br>
You chart the course for yourself and the people you work with, to expect a lot and inspire people, to have the right values, to find a way and deliver results - these are pretty fundamental things. The things you expect of people have to be so fundamental. Like a priest missionary (the seminary, The Communication Department （传理系/“仁”即“沟通”/仁者无敌） of Hong Kong Baptist University). I expect a fair amount from people. It makes them so much better. <br><br>
There was no question that there was an expectation in my family, for every member, including my children. I think some of the saddest things in the world are when you don't expect enough from your children. They have to run a higher standard. Yes, it will be a little over focused, a little tough, but that's part of the package or side effects (副作用).
As a child, you're trying to grow and meet expectations. If you focus and insist, you will win at least once. Success and achievement can feed on themselves. It feels good to keep succeeding. It’s positive feedback. Then you have the passion to win. Like addiction or maniac （上瘾/狂热）. <br><br>
Expect a lot, inspire people, ask them to take the values that are important to them at home or at church and bring them to work. <br><br>

壮游 （Grand Tour）玄奘<br><br>

The Grand Tour was the traditional trip of Europe undertaken by mainly upper-class European young men of means. The custom flourished from about 1660 until the advent of large-scale rail transit in the 1840s （大众消费）, and was associated with a standard itinerary旅程. It served as an educational rite 仪式 of passage 旅程. Though primarily associated with the British nobility and wealthy landed gentry, similar trips were made by wealthy young men of Protestant Northern European nations on the Continent, and from the second half of the 18th century some South American, U.S., and other overseas youth joined in. The tradition was extended to include more of the middle class after rail and steamship 蒸汽船 travel made the journey less of a burden.<br><br>
<a href= "link20.html">欧洲宗室源流简史</a><br><br>

The New York Times recently described the Grand Tour in this way:<br><br>

 Three hundred years ago, wealthy young Englishmen began taking a post-Oxbridge trek through France and Italy in search of art, culture and the roots of Western civilization. With nearly unlimited funds, aristocratic connections and months (or years) to roam, they commissioned paintings, perfected their language skills and mingled with the upper crust of the Continent. 英国开放，向国外先进文化学习！<br><br>

The primary value of the Grand Tour, it was believed, lay in the exposure both to the cultural legacy of classical antiquity and the Renaissance, and to the aristocratic and fashionably polite society of the European continent. In addition, it provided the only opportunity to view specific works of art, and possibly the only chance to hear certain music. A grand tour could last from several months to several years. It was commonly undertaken in the company of a Cicerone, a knowledgeable guide or tutor. The Grand Tour had more than superficial cultural importance; as E. P. Thompson stated, "ruling-class control in the 18th century was located primarily in a cultural hegemony, and only secondarily in an expression of economic or physical (military) power." <br><br>

In essence the Grand Tour was neither a scholar's pilgrimage nor a religious one,  though a pleasurable stay in Venice and a cautious residence in Rome were essential. Catholic Grand Tourists followed the same routes as Protestant Whigs. Since the 17th century a tour to such places was also considered essential for budding young artists to understand proper painting and sculpture techniques, though the trappings of the Grand Tour― valets and coachmen, perhaps a cook, certainly a "bear-leader" or scholarly guide― were beyond their reach. The advent of popular guides, such as the Richardsons', did much to popularize such trips, and following the artists themselves, the elite considered travel to such centres as necessary rites of passage. For gentlemen, some works of art were essential to demonstrate the breadth and polish they had received from their tour: in Rome antiquaries like Thomas Jenkins provided access to private collections of antiquities, among which enough proved to be for sale that the English market raised the price of such things, as well as for coins and medals, which formed more portable souvenirs and a respected gentleman's guide to ancient history. Pompeo Batoni made a career of painting English milordi posed with graceful ease among Roman antiquities. Many continued on to Naples, where they viewed Herculaneum and Pompeii, but few ventured far into southern Italy and fewer still to Greece, still under Turkish rule.<br><br>

壮游 （Grand Tour）<br><br>
壮游 （Grand Tour），"Grand Tour"是指自文艺复兴时期以后，欧洲贵族子弟进行的一种欧洲传统的旅行，后来也扩展到中欧、意大利、西班牙富有的平民阶层。壮游尤其盛行于18世纪的英国，留下了丰富的文字记述。"Grand Tour"译为“壮游”一词，典故则来自杜甫的《壮游》一诗。 <br><br>

壮游是一种教育性的成年礼，主要与英国有关，特别是英国贵族、富裕的绅士。 后来欧洲大陆北部新教国家的年轻人也有类似的旅行。到了18世纪后半，美国和其他国家的年轻人也加入旅行。《纽约时报》如此描述壮游：<br><br>

    三百年前，接受过牛桥教育的富有的英国年轻人开始前往法国和意大利各地跋涉，寻求艺术、文化和西方文明的根源。凭借几乎无限的资金，贵族接连数月或数年漫游各地，他们订购绘画，完善自己的语言技能，与欧洲大陆上流社会交往。<br><br>

壮游的主要价值，据信一方面是接触古代和文艺复兴时期的文化遗产，一方面是接触欧洲大陆的贵族和上流社会。此外，它提供了唯一的机会，观看特定的艺术品，以及听到某些音乐。一次壮游可能会持续几个月到几年，通常有博学的向导或导师陪伴。壮游超出了表面上的文化意义，正如E.P.Thompson指出，“18世纪统治阶级的控制主要体现在文化的霸权，其次才表达为经济实力或体力（军事实力）。” <br><br>

<a href= "link20.html">欧洲宗室源流简史</a><br><br>

历史<br><br>


壮游在早期受到了托马斯 科里亚特的旅行书《科里亚特莽言》（Coryat's Crudities，1611年）的影响。根据《牛津英语词典》，第一次记录到使用（也许是引进英文）壮游这个术语，是一位侨居英国的罗马天主教神甫理查德 拉塞尔斯（1603-1668年）在他的书《一次意大利之旅》，这本书在他去世后出版：1670年在巴黎，然后在伦敦  拉塞尔斯在引言中列出了“聪明完美的旅行者”的四个方面：知识的、社会的、道德的（从所有旅行者都看见的事物得到道德教育)，和政治的。<br><br>

为了满足求知欲和学习知识的旅行的想法在17世纪得到发展。约翰 洛克在《人类理解论》（1690）中广为接受的观点是，知识完全是来自外部的感觉，知识来自于环境的刺激，因此，人们可以“利用”环境，获取所有它提供的，增加自己的知识。因此，旅行对于心理发展和扩展对世界的知识是必要的。自年轻时代起一再重复壮游的历史学家爱德华 吉本指出，“按照惯例，国外旅行完成了英国绅士的教育。"。吉本有意识地要改善自己的知识修养，“以更大和更宽松的计划重访欧洲大陆”；多数壮游者在未学到超过图书馆的知识前，都不会停止自己的壮游。<br><br>

典型的18世纪观点是，勤奋的观察者游遍外域，向那些不幸地留在家中者报告他对人性的发现。对社会详细叙述自己的观察结果，以增加社会的福利，被认为是一种义务；壮游在这种想法下盛行起来 。<br><br>
北方人发现古罗马废墟和当代坎帕尼亚农民与空洞的课程之间的对比<br><br>

壮游不仅提供了博雅教育，而且使他们有机会买到在家中难以获得的东西，因此增加了参与者的威信和声望。壮游者返回时带着艺术品、书籍、绘画、雕塑，在图书馆、花园、客厅以及专门兴建的美术馆进行展示；壮游成为富有和自由的标志。特别受壮者欢迎的艺术家有肖像画画家庞培奥 巴托尼，风景画画家加纳莱托、乔瓦尼 保罗 帕尼尼和弗朗西斯科 瓜尔迪等。那些手头不太宽裕的壮游者就带回乔凡尼 巴蒂斯塔 皮拉内西的蚀刻版画粘贴簿。<br><br>

吉本的开场白中的“也许”投下了具有讽刺意味的阴影。批评者嘲笑壮游缺少冒险。“欧洲旅行是一件微不足道的事，景色乏味、清一色、缺少变化”。 壮游据说增强了关于国民性格的成见，如同让 盖查德在《熟练的绅士》（1678年）评价的：“法国人彬彬有礼。西班牙人傲慢。意大利人多情。德国人滑稽。” 英格兰的家庭对旅行产生深刻的怀疑，担心旅行会毁了英国绅士，变成1760年代和1770年代爱挖苦的本土主义眼中爱炫耀旅行的纨绔子弟。<br><br>

1825年前后蒸汽动力交通来到以后，壮游的习惯延续了下来，但是性质已有所不同―廉价、安全、舒适、向所有人开放。在19世纪大部分时间，大多数有幸受教育的年轻人都进行壮游。德国和瑞士也加入了进来。后来，由亲戚中的老处女陪伴，到意大利旅行又成为年轻女子的时尚，是上流社会妇女教育的一部分，正如爱德华 摩根 福斯特的小说《看得见风景的房间》所描写的那样。<br><br>
行程<br><br>
在罗马古装打扮的年轻英国伯爵<br><br>

最常见的壮游行程[是开始于英国的多佛，然后渡过英吉利海峡到达法国的加来。旅行者通常由一位导师陪同，如果足够富有，还会有一群仆人，获得一辆马车（在穿越阿尔卑斯山时需要拆开携带，如同贾科莫 卡萨诺瓦的旅行，旅行结束后转售）。<br><br>

在雇用一位法语向导后，旅行者及其随从就前往巴黎。在那里旅行者将开始学习法语、舞蹈、击剑和马术。巴黎的吸引力在于法国上流社会高雅的的语言和礼貌，包括宫廷举止和时尚，为年轻人回到家乡担任领导职位（经常是政府和外交）作预备。<br><br>

离开巴黎，旅行者将短暂地拜访瑞士，通常是去日内瓦（宗教改革的摇篮）或洛桑。（登山是19世纪的新产物）。从这里向前，旅行者将要忍受艰难翻越阿尔卑斯山，以便前往意大利北部（例如在大圣伯纳德山口，要分解马车和行李。如果足够富有，将会由仆人抬过艰难的地形区。<br><br>

一旦来到意大利，旅行者将会访问都灵（较少的情况是去米兰），然后在佛罗伦萨度过几个月，那里有一个相当大的英国-意大利社团，旅行的“高素质”英国人很容易接触到他们。乌菲兹美术馆的Tribuna 文艺复兴鼎盛期绘画和罗马雕塑汇聚在一个空间里，还会受到美术馆的影响，在家穿起古装。转道去比萨，然后前往帕多瓦、博洛尼亚和威尼斯。英国人认为威尼斯是“意大利颓废魅力的所在地”，使之成为壮游的一个缩影。<br><br>

从威尼斯旅行者前往罗马，研究古罗马的废墟。有些旅行者访问那不勒斯研究音乐，18世纪中叶以后还会去欣赏新近发现的庞贝和赫库兰尼姆考古遗址，也许会颤抖着冒险登上维苏威火山。后来这一阶段更为冒险，如果提供一艘帆船，可能会尝试前往西西里（古希腊废墟遗址）甚至希腊本土。但是通常的终点站是那不勒斯或者稍南面的帕埃斯图姆。<br><br>

仅管"Grand Tour"原是指流行于欧洲的一种透过长途拔涉的旅行而进行的成年仪式。而现今的“壮游”则有了他延伸的意涵。简言之，“壮游”是胸怀壮志的游历，一般来说包括了三个特质：旅游时间“长”、行程挑战性“高”、与人文社会互动“深”。特别是指经过规画，以高度意志彻底执行的游历行为。这也使得“壮游”与“探险”和“流浪”…等词的意涵有所不同。时至近代，西方青年发展出间隔年（Gap Year)的传统来进行他们的壮游，一般来说是在升学之后开学之前、或者毕业之后工作之前，所做的一次长期旅行。<br><br>

弃船逃命引起公愤 韩客轮船长面对刑事调查<br><br>
 

姜贵瑛  2014年04月18日<br><br>

载有475名乘客的韩国岁月号客轮翻沉之后，尽管韩国政府投入大规模的人力物力全面进行搜救，由于出事海域的天气恶化，到昨天截稿为止，救援工作未取得任何进展，受困者获救的希望越来越小。到昨天，已确定有18人死亡，179人获救，278人失踪。失踪者包括2名中国公民。<br><br>

海警厅官员透露，涉嫌率先弃船逃生的客轮船长正接受海岸警卫队的盘问，他面对刑事调查。<br><br>

木浦海警厅透露，这名69岁的船长李俊锡在发出求救信号40分钟后，于前天上午9时30分径自先逃。好些乘客也证实，看到船长在甲板上伺机逃命。这名船长仅受一点擦伤，被送往医院治疗。他在接受治疗被问及身份时还说:“我只是船员，什么也不知道。”<br><br>

客轮下沉时，一船之长不但不设法稳定人心，疏导乘客逃生，反而第一个跳上救生艇逃命。其行径在韩国普遍引起愤怒。<br><br>

有目击者称，该船长在获救后还忙着将浸湿的钱弄干。他在接受调查前向媒体表示，“无颜”面对对乘客和他们的家属。<br><br>

获救者纷纷也证实，事发时船上的广播一直说“乘客不要动”，结果导致许多学生无法及时逃生。<br><br>

快速改变航向或导致翻沉<br><br>

最后逃出生天的乘客金成穆（37岁）说：“因为广播一直说不要动，刚开始我和一些乘客没有动，但后来觉得不对劲，就跑到船的栏杆边。当时，第五层栏杆那边可以看到直升机和救援人员，我帮他们把学生救出来后，看到四楼有30多名学生，可是海水急速涌进来，来不及救他们。”<br><br>

对于岁月号客轮翻覆沉没的原因，韩国海洋水产部昨日表示，对船舶自动识别系统资料进行的初步分析结果显示，该客轮突然改变了航道可能是出事的原因。至于这艘船为什么急速朝右方旋转，最终结果还需进一步精密分析。<br><br>

韩国海洋警察厅也指出，该客轮在航行途中以较快的速度突然改变航向，导致船舶重心偏移，船上装载的车辆和货物移位，结果船体倾斜而翻沉。据报道，客轮上除了乘客外，还载有180辆车和1157吨货物。
<br><br>
韩国安全行政部长姜秉圭昨天表示，韩国海警当天清晨派出550多名特工队潜水员和民间潜水员前往出事海域，试图进入船体内部，但是由于洋流湍急而未能成功。<br><br>

到了下午，天气逐渐转为恶劣，浪高水急，不适宜潜水员长时间在水中工作。此外，海上还持续间歇降雨和起雾，也对搜救工作增添了难度。韩国军方定今天上午7时恢复搜救行动。<br><br>

韩国总统府朴槿惠昨日乘船到出事海域视察搜救工作。她告诉搜救队：“虽然天气不太好，但现在须要争分夺秒搜救失踪者。希望搜救队为搜救失踪者竭尽全力，同时也要全力保障搜救人员的安全。”<br><br>

她过后到乘客家属所在的珍岛体育馆表达慰问。可是乘客家属一看到总统，情绪激动。有人放声大哭，有人高声骂政府救援迟缓。<br><br>

朴槿惠说：“政府会投入所有人力和物力进行救援，发生这样的事故十分令人痛心。我们一定会查明事故原因，对责任人严惩不贷。”<br><br>

失踪者主要是安山檀园高中的学生，共有240多人，集中在该体育馆的家属包括了数百名家长，现场气氛极度悲痛。<br><br>

电影中，北韩武装人员利用南韩总统作为掩护突然占领美国白宫并劫持美国总统。片中的南韩总统就像岁月号客轮的船长，相当懦弱。
文员班宁从这次袭击中活了下来。班宁原先负责第一夫人和美国总统的保安。但是例行任务中出了错，造成了第一夫人死亡。后来，班宁就被调整到了文职工作上。 班宁逆袭出位，力挽狂澜，表现出美国式的英雄主义情操。<br><br>

中国“海归”现状调查：从政的越来越少<br><br>

南方周末 2014-04-17<br><br>


核心提示：在中国愈发融入世界的趋势下，“海归”如何能回到体制内工作？哪些因素又在限制他们成为官员？<br><br>
2014年3月，欧美同学会副会长王辉耀主编出版了一本书《百年海归创新中国》，其中收录了大批科技和商界海归精英，却几乎未涉及政治人物。“政治人物有些有争议，比如你放了孙中山、周恩来，放不放蒋介石？”王辉耀说。<br><br>

但在现实中，“海归”官员一直是中国政坛不可忽视的群体。从20世纪初孙中山等民国时代的政治家，到周恩来、邓小平等中共早期领导人，再到中共第三代领导集体，海归官员在中国已几经变迁。如今，像杨洁篪、周济等改革开放后留学欧美的一批海归官员，仍身居高位。
<br><br>
然而，中国“海归”官员的数量却有下降趋势。前不久，一位中央领导人在人民大会堂接见新一届欧美同学会领导时说，“改革开放后，中国出国留学有三百多万人，回来一百多万，比例越来越多，怎么到政府里面的人越来越少？”
<br><br>
在中国愈发融入世界的趋势下，“海归”如何能回到体制内工作？哪些因素又在限制他们成为官员？
<br><br>
15名省部级以上官员有海外正式学位
<br><br>
为了解当下中国政坛海归官员现状，南方周末记者通过搜集官方媒体报道，梳理了169位正省部级以上领导人的履历。其中包括68位现任国家领导人（包括6位兼任省委书记的中央政治局委员），以及101位正省部级官员――他们是国务院系统内各部委以及31个省份的党政负责人。
<br><br>
统计显示，169名官员中有留学经历者为31人，占18%。其中在国外取得正式学位的有15人，占总数的9%。这15人中，有11位是国家领导人，包括10位民主党派或无党派人士。<br><br>

中央核心领导层的领导人中，有留学背景的极少。1949年后，中央第一代领导核心，即毛刘周朱陈林邓七大常委中，除毛泽东外，其余6人均有在国外学习和工作的经历；中央第二代领导核心邓小平曾经先后多年留学法国、苏联；中央第三代领导集体中，江泽民、李鹏、李岚清等都曾留学苏联。<br><br>

根据统计，省部级以上官员在国外学习时间达到一年以上的共20人，占总数的12%。除取得正式学位的15人外，另有全国人大常委会副委员长张宝文、国务委员杨洁篪、全国政协副主席韩启德、国务院副秘书长肖捷、中科院院长白春礼（博士后研究）等5人在国外学习时间在一年以上。<br><br>

除山东省长郭树清出国具体时间不详以外，共有6位地方党政负责人具有海外学习背景。他们是中共中央政治局委员、重庆市委书记孙政才，湖北省委书记李鸿忠，山西省长李小鹏，内蒙古自治区主席巴特尔，广西壮族自治区主席陈武，江西省长鹿心社。不过，他们的海外进修时间都在一年以下。<br><br>

选派具有发展潜力的高级干部出国进修，始自改革开放以后。上世纪80年代中期，王辉耀在加拿大曾陪同时任国务院副总理李岚清率领的一个代表团，和加拿大政府商谈中国14个沿海开放城市官员培训项目。当时王辉耀向李岚清建议，“应加强对城市高级官员的进修和培训。”
<br><br>
这个中加合作项目最终被定位在对中国14个沿海开放城市的市长级干部培训上，许多市长第一次了解了“资本主义”是什么样。王辉耀曾陪一位市长参观多伦多和温哥华的股票市场，这位市长感慨：“看来资本市场不是一个姓资姓社的问题，而是大家都可以用的载体。”有一次，一位副市长对多伦多满大街跑的韩国汽车，而且售价只有五千多加元感到不解。王辉耀解释：“因为韩国是GATT（即如今的WTO）成员，在加拿大售车享受关税优惠。”<br><br>

最早中共干部出国主要是短期考察，主题多以经济领域为主，出国官员也大多是国有大型企业负责人或者主管经济的官员。上世纪90年代，中共十四大第一次明确提出建立社会主义市场经济口号后，中组部组织了1000名左右的地市级干部到香港学习市场经济条件下的法律、证券、房地产等知识，如今的香港特首梁振英当年还担任过授课教师。<br><br>

哈佛大学肯尼迪学院也曾培训过大批中共高级官员。1998年，在时任中组部领导支持下，“新世界哈佛高级公务员培训项目”启动。按计划，每年肯尼迪政府学院会接纳20名中国政府高级官员来此接受培训。其中4至6名官员参加一个学期的中长期培训，其他成员则参加4周的短期培训，全程英文授课。<br><br>

此后，大量中国高级官员到肯尼迪政府学院进修，官方履历显示，国务院副秘书长汪永清、湖北省委书记李鸿忠等，都曾经在哈佛大学接受培训。
<br><br>
“出国花那么多钱，当公务员不划算”<br><br>

目前体制内的“海归”官员主要分两种：一类是在国内从政并取得一定成就后，被选派到海外留学或培训；另一类是先出国留学，学业有成后归国从政。<br><br>

当下中国有海归背景的官员趋向第一类。困扰中国海归人员进入体制内的一个核心问题是体制屏障。依照正常程序，必须参加国家公务员统一考试。<br><br>

从英国伦敦政经学院硕士毕业的小姚（化名）就有类似遭遇。小姚出国前曾经在计生系统实习过，从英国回国后，她通过熟人介绍，进入国家卫生计生委下属的一个基金会工作，“通过了考试，还顺利地解决了北京市户口”。<br><br>

基金会只是事业单位，由于国家卫生计生委机关缺人，她又意外地被借调到国家卫生计生委一个司做文字工作。“我主要负责给国家领导人写稿子。”小姚的工作内容还包括撰写给国务院的请示报告，“其实是挺有意思的。”<br><br>

小姚还属于基金会的事业编制，若想转入公务员体系，必须在原基金会熬到副处级以上。为了尽早解决编制问题，2013年底，小姚参加了一次国家公务员考试，“考得很差。”小姚说，像她这样的海归，习惯了做雅思考试那种直来直去的逻辑，“完全适应不了国情，很难通过考试”。<br><br>

一些进入体制内的高层官员，多经由“特殊渠道”进入。2001年2月，中国政府委任香港证监会副主席史美伦担任中国证监会副主席。史美伦曾回忆说，当时国务院总理朱F基通过朋友向她传达信息，想请她到中国证监会当副主席，全职，在北京工作。史美伦当时很惊奇，“也很感谢国家领导人的信任”。<br><br>

2010年进入国务院发展研究中心工作的处级干部张翔（化名）也没有经过考试。张翔在德国攻读博士学位期间，因为一个偶然机会，认识了国务院发展研究中心一位领导。<br><br>

经过一段时间接触后，领导很赏识他，希望他加入。“恰好我想回国，就回来进入了国务院发展研究中心。”张翔告诉南方周末记者，他没有参加国家公务员统一考试，是直接进去的，“他们启用了绿色通道，用特殊人才引进的方式把我招进来，这样职务安排上弹性也大。”
<br><br>
2011年，王辉耀曾联合哈佛大学肯尼迪学院中国学生联合会做过一个调查，对30位中国籍毕业生的去向做了一个统计。结果显示，过去4年，学院的中国籍研究生毕业后，除非入学前就是在政府部门工作或被派遣培养，至今没有一人在中央或地方政府部门工作。
<br><br>
“跟小孩一块考试是我不能接受的。”张翔觉得，让一个三十好几的人参加考公务员考试“很荒谬”。张翔有个朋友毕业于复旦大学，后在德国海德堡大学读了硕士，回国后参加了中央编译局的公务员考试。张翔很不理解，“在德国花那么多钱读书，回来又从很低的行政职务干起，没什么意思。”<br><br>

对于大多数学成归国的“海归”来说，外资企业毫无疑问是就业首选。根据《中国海归发展报告》（2013年）显示，薪酬、职业发展和福利是影响高端人才流动的三大因素。超过四分之一的海归会选择进入外企就业，其他就业单位依次为本土创业民营企业、事业单位、国有企业和海归创业民营企业。政府部门是最末选项。<br><br>

对于进入“体制内”的海归来说，薪酬显然不是主要考虑因素。一位海归在一家中国500强公司做到了副总裁，“因为特别擅长交通管理专业，他希望能参与北京交通部门的管理工作”。这位副总裁对王辉耀说，“我可以不拿工资，只干一届五年就退。”
<br><br>
国家人社部一位80后海归，在国内最顶尖的协和医科大学本硕连读后，又到哈佛大学读了博士。回国后考取了人社部公务员。“她家里条件不错，进入体制内主要是希望稳定。”她的一位同事说，“对家里条件一般的人来说，出国读书花那么多钱，回国当公务员不划算。”
<br><br>
没明显限制也没有格外照顾
<br><br>
从新加坡、美国等西方国家的官员产生机制看，官员并非都从最底层开始做起。一些重要职位人选往往先由社会培养，当其成熟和优秀后再吸收到政府。王辉耀认为：“好处是避免官员在政府中待太久而产生惰性。”
<br><br>
中国国家公务员的招考，对海归没有明显限制，但也没有格外照顾。小姚举例说，“比如卫生计生委国际合作司欧美处要招一个公务员，不会写留学经历优先，只会要求英语专业毕业。”对像小姚这样从英国名牌大学毕业的求职者来说，英语读写能力已经毫无问题，“但我专业是社会学，不是英语专业，所以不能去报这样的岗位。”
<br><br>
大多数公务员岗位还要求报名者必须是中共党员，这也让大多数海归望而却步。一位中共中央统战部的干部说：统战部干部基本没有海归，“因为我们这里全部是中共党员”。
<br><br>
“我们党政机关也有海归，多数都是从高校领导岗位转过来的。”江西省委组织部一位官员告诉南方周末记者，“我们主要是鼓励海归进入高校或科研单位，怎么会鼓励海归进机关呢？”这位组织部官员介绍，公务员考试方面，海归人才并无受到优先考虑，大家一视同仁，“审查也没有更严格，都是一样的”。<br><br>

这也是中国人民大学大三学生李淼（化名）非常困惑的问题。李淼一直想出国读书，他把研究方向定在民族冲突问题。前几天他向学校国关学院一位副院长请教，“学民族冲突问题回来能不能进入民委等机构工作？”副院长说，“不行，经济或者商务部门还好，涉及国家安全的部门肯定不好进。”<br><br>

经济领域的确是海归加入体制内的方向，这与中国参与经济全球化的程度直接相关。简晶晶2005年从英国花旗银行辞职，回国加盟中国一家刚成立的金融监管机构。她对南方周末记者说，金融领域不涉及意识形态问题，必须按市场标准去做事，“比如说我做一笔贷款的评估，要考虑风险、消费者权益保护等等，国外的成熟做法值得中国借鉴。”
<br><br>
相比较在英国花旗银行工作时的稳定，简晶晶觉得在中国最直接的感受是――变化，“你要对英国人说变化，他会告诉你，我家门口的牌子变了个名字。哇塞，那是巨大的变化。”回国进入金融监管部门，简晶晶一个很大的考量因素是，“中国是一个正在发展的市场，你做的很多事情确实能推动市场的变化。这是在任何国家没有办法体验和学习的。”
<br><br>
“海归从政在国外可能是趋势，但对于中国来说，取决于是走国际化道路还是走中国道路。”一位研究海归问题的中国人民大学老师告诉南方周末记者，“看我们学校就能看出来，商院、经济学院的海归老师多，外籍教师也多。但是，国际关系学院、马克思主义学院还是大量招国内的博士。”<br><br>

长期关注海归问题的王辉耀有个想法，既然海归直接进入政府比较难，那可以放宽海归进入到其他类机构的角色，“比如进入人大、政协，可以给政府提建议，发挥智力优势嘛。”

高晓松：不买房，买梦想<br><br>

2014-04-28<br><br>

关于房子，我跟大多数人概念不一样。我从小住在清华校园里，家是那种二层的小楼，外表看起来很普通，面积也不是特大，但是特别安静。<br><br>


这地儿都没动过，也没装修之说，从我生下来就是这样红色的，很老很旧。但我在那儿真觉得挺好，有一个家，不仅仅是睡觉的地方，我自己也不知道这房子多少年了，我们也在感慨：后边的院子多好啊，出门就是操场、游泳馆，还有漂亮的女生，白发的先生；四周的邻居，随便踹开一家的门，里面住的都是中国顶级的大知识分子，进去聊会儿天怎么都长知识，梁思成林徽因就住我前面的院子。小时候有什么问题家里老人就写一张字条，说这问题你问谁谁谁。我找到人家家里，打开字条一看，哦，你是那谁家的孩子，那你讲吧，都是中国头把交椅啊。这才是住处真正的意义吧，它让你透气，而不是豪华的景观、户型和装修什么的。<br><br>


2007年，我们搬了出来，因为家人都在国外，我又不在清华教书，学校就把房子收回去了，后来我去了洛杉矶。<br><br>


去了美国，我一样是无房户，坚定的无房主义者。刚去美国的时候，我做编剧和开发，只卖出了两首电影歌曲。美国流行音乐是草根文化，美国卖吉他的黑人当我师傅都有富余，不是说他弹得比我好，是同样一个琴我们弹的都不是一个级别，出的声音都不一样。国外很多伟大的乐队，都是一个班的同学，在中国整个高校也选拔不出一个牛的乐队。为啥？国内很多年轻人的热情都分散了，赚钱的热情大过音乐本身，比如买房。<br><br>


郑钧有一天跟我说，有些艺术家被抓进精神病院，成了精神病；有些精神病人从精神病院逃出来，成为艺术家，你就是那后者，你的生活就像行为艺术。不过，我肯定不属于时尚人士，因为从来不关注别人的流行趋势，也算不上中产阶级，如果我的钱只够旅行或是买房子，那我就去旅行。<br><br>


平时除了听听歌，看看电影，我最大的爱好就是满世界跑着玩。大概去过三十多个国家了，到一个地方就买一辆车，然后玩一段时间就把车卖了，再去下一个地方。<br><br>


经常在旅途中碰上一堆人，然后很快成为朋友，然后喝酒，然后下了火车各自离去。之前还在欧洲碰见一个东欧乐队，我帮人弹琴，后来还跟人卖艺去了，跟着人到处跑到处弹唱，到荷兰，到西班牙，到丹麦……我妈也是，一个人背包走遍世界，我妈现在还在流浪，在考察美国天主教遗址。<br><br>


我妹也是，也没有买房，她挣的钱比我多得多。之前她骑摩托横穿非洲，摩托车在沙漠小村里坏了，她索性就在那里生活两个月等着零件寄到。然后在撒哈拉沙漠一小村子里给我写一个明信片，叫做“彩虹之上”，她在明信片里告诉我说，哥，我骑了一个宝马摩托，好开心。我看到沙漠深处的血色残阳，与酋长族人喝酒，他们的笑容晃眼睛……因为我跟我妹都不买房，你知道你只要不买房，你想开什么车开什么车。你想，你一个厕所的面积就恨不得能买一奔驰。然后她就开一宝马摩托，坏了，说整个非洲都没这零件，她说你知道我现在在做什么吗？我在撒哈拉一个小村子里给人当导游。<br><br>


我妈从小就教育我们，不要被一些所谓的财产困住。所以我跟我妹走遍世界，然后我俩都不买房，就觉得很幸福。我妈说生活不是眼前的苟且，生活有诗和远方。我和我妹妹深受这教育。谁要觉得你眼前这点儿苟且就是你的人生，那你这一生就完了。生活就是适合远方，能走多远走多远；走不远，一分钱没有，那么就读诗，诗就是你坐在这，它就是远方。越是年长，越能体会我妈的话。<br><br>


美国人平均31岁才第一次购房，德国人42岁，比利时人37岁，欧洲拥有独立住房的人口占50%，剩下都是租房。为什么现在中国的年轻人一毕业就结婚？一结婚就买房？怎样才能买到房？一套房子会限制你所有的行为和决定。因为你知道，要一提裸婚，没有人愿意嫁给你。即使老婆愿意，他们家人呢？别人会怎么看？孩子以后怎么办？以今天的房价，普通人买房只有两种情况，一种是双方父母出钱资助，这种人基本上前途和发展被父母控股。第二种人是牺牲了太多的发展机会，典当梦想来成就一套房子。他们购买的，其实是自己内心深处的“安全感”。他们觉得，有一套房子，会让自己内心安全一点儿。但是安全感真的可以来自于一套房子吗？归根结底，还是价值观的问题。世界再怎么变，还是要有坚持，即使它是落后。我不入流，这不要紧。我每一天开心，这才是重要的。<br><br>

WSJ China Column: Young children’s classes: Too much pressure too soon?<br><br>
As parents we all want to give our kids every advantage, and in our hypercompetitive world, it’s easy to get caught up in what’s become an arms race of ever-more classes at ever younger ages.<br><br>
And as in any arms race, it’s easy to get so caught up in escalating for the sake of escalating that we lose sight of our goals.<br><br>
At some point we should ask: is all this investment of time and money really benefiting our children?<br><br>
‘Don’t you feel it’s important to give kids a good start?’<br><br>
My husband and I are not experts in parenting. To the contrary, we’re just like every other set of parents on Earth, just trying to do the best with the resources that we have.<br><br>
We have two daughters: Pip is now four and Lila is two-and-a-half. Recently, a friend dropped by to visit us, and promptly was welcomed into an imaginary tea party that they were having.<br><br>
Delighted, my friend exclaimed: ‘Your girls are so happy! So friendly! Not at all like other Chinese kids!’<br><br>
She asked what activities they do. Well, Pip just started a Tae Kwon Do class, I said, and tennis. Lila has yet to start any formal activities.<br><br>
My friend’s delight turned to concern.<br><br>
‘Your girls don’t play piano yet? But haven’t you heard that piano lessons should start by age four?<br><br>
‘They haven’t started ballet? Chess? No academic tutoring at all?’<br><br>
No, no, and no.<br><br>
Actually we avoid packing our girls’ schedules too full, I explained. When they’re awake and not in school, our girls love to play together, swinging in the playground, pretending with their dolls, cutting and gluing paper together in (very) abstract art projects.<br><br>
When their favorite songs play on the radio, they love to sing and dance along, but they just don’t seem ready yet for more formal music training.<br><br>
My friend was quiet. Then: ‘Don’t you feel it’s important to give kids a good start when they’re young?’<br><br>
Emotional development and creative play<br><br>
It’s not that we don’t focus on our kids’ development. But at this stage in their lives, we’re focusing on the skills that we consider most important to their future success. And happily for our girls and for us, our approach to parenting emphasizing emotional development and creative play ― involves less pressure and more fun for everyone.<br><br>
In his intriguing book Brain Rules for Baby, neurologist John Medina describes the physiological changes occurring in a child’s brain between the ages of zero and five. During this time, a child’s brain is developing rapidly, he says, and parenting that helps a child’s emotional development actually helps his neural architecture develop toward lifelong emotional stability.<br><br>
A child parented this way will become an adult with better self-control, fewer incidences of depression and anxiety disorders, greater empathy, deeper and richer friendships, and many more friends.<br><br>
Dr. Medina’s conclusions feel right to me. Having been a political leader and a CEO headhunter, by now I’ve met tens of thousands of people in many countries, and it seems to me that the happiest and most successful people are not those who are best at following the rules.<br><br>
The happiest and most successful people are the ones who understand the rules, but then choose how to live their own lives. They have self-confidence and creativity and they understand keenly how to relate to others.<br><br>
Pip is learning to be more assertive武断/独断；肯定的；刚毅坚定而自信的<br><br>
Our approach to parenting is embraced by the school we chose, and recently we went there to discuss Pip’s development.
The teacher started off by assuring us that Pip’s schoolwork is progressing well. Every time they start a new project, she said, the other kids crowd around to see how Pip solves the problem.<br><br>
Then she said: ‘What we’re working on with Pip is her assertiveness. Especially around boys.’<br><br>
She gave an example:<br><br>
‘Just yesterday, Pip was playing next to a sandbox where two boys were throwing sand around, and some sand flew in Pip’s direction. She got up, found me and asked me to tell the boys to be more careful. I asked if she had said anything to them herself. She said no. I asked her if she wanted me help her address the boys, and she said yes.<br><br>
So we went over, and I suggested some words she could use: ‘I was sitting here and felt some of your sand hit me. Please stop throwing sand in my direction.’ Pip repeated these words. The boys apologized and promised to be more careful.
I asked Pip if she was happy with the outcome and she said yes. Then I asked her if the next time something like this happened, she felt she could resolve the problem herself, and she agreed to try.’<br><br>
Self-confidence, creativity and the ability to relate to others.<br><br>
When the teacher shared this example, I felt especially moved, because as I’ve written before in this column, I’ve always had trouble saying no to other people. Once I got stuck in a destructive boyfriend relationship precisely because as an adult I didn’t know how to protect myself in the way that my four-year-old now is learning to do.<br><br>
Maybe if we get this parenting thing right, our kids will struggle less with the things I’ve struggled with, and perhaps then their lives will be better.<br><br>
In our hypercompetitive, hurry-up world, we always assume that fast beats slow, but what do we risk if we pressure our kids to do too much too soon?<br><br>
Self-confidence, creativity, the ability to relate to others: these are the skills and brain development processes that we’re trying to nurture in our kids and that may remain undeveloped if formal learning monopolizes their time and attention.<br><br>
Are my husband and I parenting our kids well? At this point, it’s impossible to know. They certainly seem to be enjoying a more fun childhood than some of their peers.<br><br>
But is our way of parenting the right way to help them reach their potential as happy and successful future young women? We hope and believe the answer is yes. But only time will tell for sure.<br><br>

华尔街日报专栏：送幼儿上补习班是否操之过急？<br><br>
By 陈愉 Joy Chen May 13, 2013 <br><br>
Filed Under  幼儿, 补习班<br><br>
来自阳光明媚的洛杉矶的问候!  这里的春天来了，跟Dave以及女儿们在一起的生活充满了乐趣。妹妹现在两岁半，看她每天都学会一些新的中文和英文单词很有趣。<br><br>
打网球让我感觉健康而强壮<br><br>
《时尚健康》的五月刊已经可以在报亭买到了，很高兴能出现在这个月的运动女性专题里。在看到这些照片之前，我都还没意识到网球已经把我的手臂变得像米歇尔. 奥巴马的一样了！<br><br>

不到两年前，我还带着因怀孕而增加的20公斤体重，并且因为之前连续四年的怀孕和哺乳感到疲惫不堪。就是这个时候，我亲爱的婆婆Lennie告诫我要留出时间给自己。她已经75岁，并且通过锻炼保持着令人惊讶的体型。Lennie促使我走向网球。<br><br>
现在43岁，我跟自己承诺每周要健身数次。为了能在网球场上追赶婆婆，我必须保持身形。打网球让我感觉健康而强壮, 我喜欢这种感觉。毕竟，我努力工作为他人，网球却是 “me-time.” “Me-time”是大家都需要的。<br><br>
TEDx演讲与五月底回国<br><br>
四月的时候，我发表了个人第一次TEDx中文演讲，名为“和女士们聊聊天(男人可以偷听)”你可以在这里观看。<br><br>
很高兴的告诉大家: 我会在5月底回中国，一直待到7月末。我会约见朋友并跟一些旨在帮助女性变得更自由、快乐和自信的杰出的公司扩展合作。在这个期间，Dave 和我们的女儿也将加入我几周。<br><br>
我最新的一篇街日报中文版专栏是我第一个关于育儿之道的文章。以下文字为专栏全文，经华尔街日报中文网允许，转载于本博客。<br><br>
街日报中文版专栏文章: 小孩子的功课: 压力太多太早?<br><br>
为人父母的我们都希望能够给孩子提供一切优势，在现在这个竞争激烈的世界上，让孩子们加入比拼才艺的“军备竞赛”可谓易如反掌，可供孩子们选择的补习课程越来越多，孩子们开始接受辅导的年龄也越来越小。<br><br>
和所有的军备竞赛如出一辙，儿童才艺大比拼也非常容易陷入为竞争而竞争的恶性循环之中，以至于我们会失去为何而争的目标。<br><br>
某些时候我们应该扪心自问：我们投入的时间和金钱是否真的能使我们的孩子受益？<br><br>
“你不觉得给孩子一个成功的起点至关重要吗？”<br><br>
丈夫和我都不是育儿专家。相反，我们和世界上所有的家长一样，只是在竭尽全力地为孩子们提供我们力所能及的一切资源。<br><br>
我们有两个女儿：姐姐四岁，妹妹两岁半。最近，一位朋友顺路拜访我家，由于当时我们正在举办一场梦幻茶会，我们便马上邀请这位朋友加入了我们。<br><br>
我的朋友欢快地大声说：“你们的女儿们看起来可真快乐！真友好！和其他中国小孩一点儿也不一样！”<br><br>
她询问到孩子们都在进行什么样的活动。姐姐刚开始上跆拳道课，还有网球课，我说。妹妹现在还没有正式开展任何活动。<br><br>
我朋友的表情瞬间由喜转忧。<br><br>
“你的女儿们还没学弹钢琴？但你没听过吗，钢琴课应该在四岁就开始了？”<br><br>
“她们还没开始学芭蕾？国际象棋？从来没上过学业辅导班？”<br><br>
我喃喃地回答：“没有，没有，没有。”<br><br>
我解释到，实际上，我们尽量避免把孩子们的时间表安排得过满。在她们不睡觉也不在学校的时间里，她们喜欢一起玩耍，在游戏场上荡秋千，和布娃娃过家家，还喜欢把纸片剪剪粘粘成非常抽象的艺术作品。<br><br>
当收音机里播出她们喜欢的歌曲时，她们总是边唱边跳，只不过她们看起来还没准备好接受更为正式的音乐训练。<br><br>
我的朋友陷入了沉默。随后她说：“你不觉得在孩子们小的时候，给她们一个成功的起点至关重要吗？”<br><br>
情感发育及创造性游戏<br><br>
并不是我们不注重孩子们的发展。但是在她们生命中的这个阶段，我们正着重培养我们认为对她们今后的成功最为重要的技能。幸运的是，对两个女儿和我们夫妻来说，我们的育儿方式──重视情感发育及创造性游戏──给每个人都带来了更多的快乐，同时施加了更少的压力。<br><br>
神经学家约翰 梅迪纳(John Medina)在他引人入胜的著作《让孩子的大脑自由》(Brain Rules for Baby)中，介绍了大脑在幼儿零至五岁间发生的生理学变化。他表示，在这个期间，儿童大脑的发育非常迅速，有助于儿童情感发育的育儿方式事实上能够帮助儿童神经系统的构建和发育，并使他们朝着终生情绪稳定的方向成长。<br><br>
用这样的方式培养出的孩子日后将成为一名自控力更强、罹患抑郁和焦虑症的概率更低、更富同情心、更易建立深厚友情、拥有更多朋友的成年人。<br><br>
梅迪纳博士得出的结论引起了我的共鸣。曾经作为政界领袖和高管猎头的工作经历，使我有幸接触到了数以万计、来自不同国家的人，在我看来，最快乐、最成功的人并不是那些最善于遵循规则的人。<br><br>
最快乐、最成功的人是那些明白规则，但选择按照自己的方式生活的人。他们充满自信、拥有创造力，并且深知该如何与人交往。<br><br>
大女儿正在学习如何做到自信<br><br>
我们的育儿方式得到了我们给女儿所选择的学校的赞同，为了和老师沟通大女儿的教育问题，我们最近拜访了学校。<br><br>
老师首先肯定地告诉我们，女儿的课堂任务完成得很好。她说，每次同学们开始做新课业时，其他孩子都会围过去看女儿是如何解决问题的。<br><br>
她接着说：“我们正在帮助她增加自信，特别是当有男孩子在身边的时候。”<br><br>

她 举例子说：“就在昨天，她正在沙盒旁边玩，两个男孩儿扬起沙子嬉戏起来，一些沙子因此被撒到了她身上。她站起来，找到我，并请我去告诉男孩们应该小心点。 我问她有没有自己和他们讲过这件事情。她说没有。我又问她，是不是想让我帮她和男孩们交涉，她说是的。所以我们走过去，我向她建议了一些可用的措辞，比如，我刚才坐在这儿，你们扬起的沙子打到了我。请不要朝我这边扬沙子。她复述了这些话。男孩们道了歉，并且保证会小心点。”<br><br>
我问大女儿对于这样的解决方式是否满意，她说是的。然后我又问，下次如果有类似的事情发生，她是不是能够自己解决问题，她答应试一试。<br><br>
自信、创造力和人际交往能力<br><br>
当老师和我分享发生在女儿身上的事情时，我被深深地触动了，因为正如我以前在这个专栏中所写的那样，其实我一直都不善于对别人说“不”。我还曾经陷入一段极具破坏性的感情，原因就是作为一个成年人，我并不知道该如何保护自己，而我四岁的女儿现在正在学习此道。
如果我们能做到用正确的方式抚育子女，我们的孩子将不会像我当初那样备受煎熬，或许她们的生活将更美好。<br><br>
生活在这个竞争激烈、快节奏的世界上，我们一向都认为快胜过慢，但是如果我们过早地给孩子们施加过多的压力，是否在拔苗助长？<br><br>
自信、创造力和人际交往能力<br><br>
自信、创造力和人际交往能力，这些都是我们千方百计想要孩子们学到的技能，同时也是大脑不断发育的过程。如果正规学习占据了孩子们的时间和精力，那么我们的追求可能将落空。<br><br>
丈夫和我在子女教育上成功吗？现在，我们还一无所知。不过我们确定的是，和很多同龄人相比，她们的童年看起来更快乐。<br><br>
我们的育儿方式是激发她们潜能，并帮助她们成为未来快乐成功的年轻女性的正确方式吗？我们希望并相信：答案是肯定的。但是只有时间能真正揭开谜底。<br><br>

美国亚裔面对更大教育竞争压力<br><br>

2014年04月04日<br><br>


于时语专栏<br><br>

4月1日愚人节也是美国传统的大学招生发榜截止日，大学招生成为媒体重要题材。常春藤和其他名校的录取率又创新低：今年哈佛大学录取率只有5.9%，斯丹福大学更牛，创造了全美最低录取率5.07%！被名校录取的幸运儿中，纽约长岛的黑人学生艾宁（Kwasi Enin）居然获得所有八所常春藤大学同时录取，成为美国传媒竞相报道的最新名人。<br><br>

精英报刊如《纽约时报》和《华盛顿邮报》也刊登许多文章，批判大学入学竞争的白热化，哀叹这造成中学生和家长们的极大压力。这些批评抱怨大都来自WASP（白人盎格鲁撒克逊新教徒）家庭，一如他们几年前对《虎妈战歌》代表的亚裔家庭教育的激烈批判，反映了主流白人在教育竞争中日渐落后。<br><br>

“天子重英豪，文章教尔曹。万般皆下品，唯有读书高。”这是中国科举时代的社会哲理，因为只有科举考试才是精英阶层的入场券。可是在后工业化的美国，却出现了全社会的“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”：高等教育成为维持中产阶级地位的关键。<br><br>

经济全球化和高科技自动化之下，美国低教育蓝领中产阶级不断沉沦，大学毕业生相对于中学毕业生的平均收入比例，逼近乃至超过两倍。去年牛津大学学者对美国职场作出一项研究。结论在未来廿年中，美国全部702种职业群体中，将近一半（47%）职位“有高度可能被自动化和机器人取代”！大学教育对社会经济地位的重要性，不言而喻。<br><br>

在教育竞争中，亚裔是个赢家，很大程度上是传统文化因素，特别是极其注重子女教育的华裔，在美国教育费用尤其高等教育费用飞涨趋势下，亚裔的教育优势，也归功于父母不惜工本和自我牺牲作出的教育开支和投入。<br><br>

据2010年美国人口普查，美国成人正规大学毕业生比率不到30%，可是亚裔却超过52%。在决定高端经济收入和进入“上层建筑”机会的精英教育上，亚裔硕士学位比率是12%，高出白人六成；至于博士学位比率，亚裔（3%）超过白人的两倍，是黑人和拉美裔的七倍。教育竞争成功反映到经济收入上，亚裔家庭年收入超过十万美元的百分比是32%，超过白人一半，是黑人和拉美裔的三倍。<br><br>

所以美国的社会竞争，日益集中到“教育战线”。前些时候沸沸扬扬的加州SCA5提案是个典型。这是拉美裔州参议员提出的，他嫌包括著名伯克莱大学的加州大学系统亚裔学生太多，要求提高拉美裔和黑人入学比率。此案已通过州参议院，如果在州众议会也获得通过，将於今年11月公投，恢复1996年取消的加大校园中基于族裔的的平权法案，照顾多收拉美裔和黑人。<br><br>

这一新提案得到民主党的积极支持，却明显是对亚裔教育和经济利益的重大威胁，引起政治参与感淡薄而且倾向民主党的亚裔尤其华裔人口前所未有的政治动员。在亚裔族群全力反对之下，加州议会被迫同意搁置这项提案。<br><br>

这一争议彰显了亚裔和华裔在美国大学招生过程中受到的逆向歧视，在其他同样的条件和学习成绩下，他们进入“重点”大学和名牌大学的机会明显低于其他族裔。今年被八所常春藤大学录取的黑人学生艾宁正是例证。<br><br>

艾宁的SAT“高考”分数是2250分，这在满分2400分“状元”比比皆是的华裔中毫不稀奇。艾宁在一个普通高中647名应届毕业生中只是排名11，而近年来“重点中学”华裔状元（毕业班第一名）”和“榜眼”多如牛毛。除了一些校内荣誉，艾宁并无州一级的奖项，而在全国性竞赛中脱颖而出的亚裔华裔成百上千。这些有全国性荣誉和SAT满分的亚裔，许多仍然被常春藤拒之门外。可是像艾宁那样的黑人学生实在凤毛麟角，而成为常春藤争抢的宝贝。<br><br>

由此联系到美国高校理事会（College Board）在乌克兰危机中宣布的“SAT高考”新一轮改革，从2400满分恢复到早先1600分满分，考试内容也有显著变动。这一改革的表面理由，是增加弱势群体的教育机会，但是行家们都指出改革的实质是降低难度（dumb-down），以此改善穷人和少数民族考生的成绩。这又是对考分突出的亚裔不利的发展。<br><br>

教育竞争超越学校课堂和考试，而进入社会政治领域，是美国亚裔和华裔必须密切关注的趋势。<br><br>	

'We’re Not This Alien Group': Chinese Students on Fitting In at U.S. Colleges<br><br>

A series of YouTube videos attempts to explain how foreign students struggle at American schools. 
<br><br>

Lauren Davidson
<br><br>

Nov 1 2013
<br><br>
Four Chinese students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where Chinese enrollment has grown 356 percent in the last decade, have set out to educate their American peers about themselves. They’ve taken to YouTube to explain the social misunderstandings that block many foreign students―particularly those from Asia―from integrating with the slang-speaking, booze-guzzling Americans.<br><br>



International students are flocking to US universities in greater numbers, particularly from Asia, but the cultural barriers are as sturdy as ever. Since 2007, the number of Chinese students in the US has grown by around one-fifth or more each year. In the 2011/2012 academic year, 194,029 students from China were enrolled in higher education in the US―an increase of 23 percent from the year before, according to the Institute of International Education.

<br><br>

 

But they still have a hard time fitting into American culture, and this “adjustment fatigue” can lead to isolation. A recent report showed that one in four Chinese students studying at Ivy League universities drop out before graduation. Many of those who do graduate return to China after university; a third of those who do cited poor social skills as the reason.
<br><br>


 

The most popular video on the students’ YouTube channel, with 40,000-plus views, explains why Chinese students prefer to speak Mandarin instead of English: Aside from the obvious reason―that it’s their native language―Chinese schools teach pupils English to pass tests, not chat conversationally. Words like “peeps,” “chillax,” “fo’ real” and “fo’ sho” don’t make the syllabus, and can make Chinese students feel alienated when talking with Americans.

<br><br>



Other videos discuss “Why Chinese Students Don’t Party,” (they place a higher value on studying, and are “treated like this alien person who doesn’t know how to have fun” in drink-fueled social situations), “Pretty Chinese Women,” (in which American and Chinese male students discuss their differing concepts of beauty), and “Chinese Names,” (whose tricky pronunciation can hinder the forming of friendships).

<br><br>

 

“We’re not this alien ‘other’ group,” Cecilia Miao, one of the channel’s founders, told the Wisconsin State Journal. “We should try to celebrate differences, not ignore it.”<br><br>

直面游学风，如何看待境外境内两重天 <br><br>



2012-07-10 光明网综合 <br><br>




    核心提示：暑假又到，如何让孩子尤其参加完高考后的学子更加有意义地度过这一段宝贵的时间，家长又在绞尽脑汁地开始“策划”了，而各大旅行机构也早已做好准备。动辄几万元的游学费是否为广大家长和孩子所接受？国际游学又究竟是“游”还是“学”？舍近求远的背后又反映出哪些问题值得我们深思？<br><br>

游学“立志” 效果如何？
<br><br>
    读万卷书，行万里路。一放暑假，游学立即热了起来。很多孩子放下书包，背上行李，踏上旅程，开始自己的游学之旅。

<br><br>

都到哪里游学？一查网络，各种夏令营都有，主题各有不同，体育营、口才营、英语营、减肥营、拓展营、亲子营、领袖营……有的，去北京，参观天安门，参观科技馆，或者到清华、北大校园；有的，去云南、海南，领略大自然的风光；有的，到山区老家或西北贫困地区体验生活，忆苦思甜；更有的，到美国、英国、澳大利亚，云游世界著名高校的校园，参观哈佛大学、普林斯敦，顺便立下以后非到此地读书不可的伟大宏愿……<br><br>

    记者采访时发现，多数家长都在游学中加入了浓厚的“立志”目的。游学，到底能否承受“立志”之重？效果如何？
<br><br>
    按语文课本游学<br><br>

    林林妈是个有心人，她在政府机关工作，丈夫是教师，一向对孩子的教育问题很重视。从小学一年级开始，她家就形成了一个习惯：一年3次远足旅游，暑假两次，寒假一次，雷打不动。都到哪些地方去呢？林林的语文课本就是向导。<br><br>

    新疆的葡萄沟（《葡萄沟》）去过了，云南的泼水节（《难忘的泼水节》）体验过了，北京夜晚的灯光（《北京亮起来了》）领略了，河北石家庄的赵州桥（《赵州桥》）也走过了，连香港（《璀璨的明珠》）也造访了，“现在国内的就差海南的西沙群岛（《富饶水魔方》）没去了。课文中后来再出现过孩子去过的地方，比如《鸟的天堂》讲云南的鸟，讲西安的秦兵马俑，尽管可能没具体见过，但都很容易和见过的当地实物结合起来，再上网查点资料，觉得很具体，很亲切。”林林妈说，江南的景点去得更多，杭州的西湖、绍兴的兰亭、南京的秦淮河，结合俞平伯、朱自清等人的同题散文去看，收获很大。现在，林林很喜欢读游记，四年级的他，走到哪里，书包里都有一本余秋雨的《山居笔记》。<br><br>

    陪孩子游学美国<br><br>

    15天的游学中，5天在旧金山，入住当地人家，一一和小伙伴们将把自己制作的有关中国文化的英语PPT介绍给当地学生，并和他们同堂比赛；2天在洛杉矶，他会去迪士尼、环球影城；5天在美国东部旅行，他会去向往已久的常青藤名校哈佛、麻省，亲身感受这些著名学府独有的人文气息和文化氛围，当然还有费城、纽约、华盛顿，还有白宫、国会大厦、自由女神像、华尔街、时代广场、联合国总部大厦、百老汇……这些以往只能在电视中看到的建筑。<br><br>

    尽管费用不菲，一一的妈妈决定自己全陪。为的是什么？一来为了自己也增长点见识，以后儿子作选择时能给个有价值的参考意见。二来为了提高儿子这次游学的收获度，关键时刻给儿子一个点拨。“说实话,是想让孩子的游学变得更有价值，这个成本实在是有点高。”一一妈妈有些无奈，但更多的是期待。<br><br>

    游学英国收获大<br><br>

    在剑桥小镇上一家150多年历史的皮具店里，妞妞和店主聊了起来，谈到了小店的历史，来往的游客以及剑桥一些著名的人物和电影，这时候，妞妞高出同龄人很多的英语口语能力派上了用场，交流基本无障碍。那条街来往的游客不多，但是一家皮具店能有百年历史，一定有它不寻常的特点。还有些国际知名的NGO在小镇上也有不大的店面，卖一些大家捐助的物品和书籍，价格低廉得出奇，所有收益都捐给一些贫困地区和国家作为当地儿童的教育救助。妞妞了解后，买了不少书。<br><br>

    在伦敦，除了大英博物馆和国家美术馆这些向往已久的地方，其他时间基本都是逛小街小店。可以在书店里静静待半天，也可以在乐器店和店主店员讨论一些音乐问题，在这些保护完好的古城里漫步，给人一种心灵沉静的感觉。游学的时间虽短，经历却是不同一般，在这个过程中，妞妞学会了独立，学会了思考。她的留学梦变得更真实，也更坚定了。（金华日报）<br><br>

    36800元逛奥特莱斯购物?<br><br>

    以美国东西海岸14日游为例，锦旅、国旅，以及青旅等沪上几家较大规模的旅行社，报价都在23000元到28000元之间。而新东方、英孚等培训机构发布的游学团广告，报价普遍达到了38000元左右。今年大热的英国奥运游，旅行社10天报价在16000元到20000元之间，游学团则开价28000元至30000元。<br><br>

     除了价格，游学团和普通团的最大不同就是行程中多了“学”的内容，但这些“学”大多指的是去名校“到此一游”。
近年来，“修学游”成了旅游业的热门词汇，其宣称的寓教于乐、寓教于游的卖点，受到了不少家长和学生的热捧。据记者了解，目前“修学游”产品分为国内游和国际游。相较于利润较低的国内游，目前各大旅行社、培训机构、留学中介等更倾向于推出以美国、英国、澳大利亚等英语国家为主的国际游产品。<br><br>

    “国际游学的利润空间很大，以美国为例，如果能够拿到便宜的机票，组织机构从每个营员身上至少会赚到5000元。”一位长期在国际游学组织工作的人士告诉中国青年报记者，由于今年伦敦举办奥运会，很多组织游学的机构把目光放在了文化多元、名校林立的美国。
<br><br>
    在某培训机构的网站上，中国青年报记者联系在线客服人员得知，如果现在想参加美国的修学游，只剩一个线路还有名额，因为很多同学3个月前就已经报了名。<br><br>

    不仅如此，记者在该机构的网站上发现，修学游产品个个价格不菲，短短十几天的行程，报价基本在3万元以上。如“斯坦福大学领导才能夏令营(14天)”报价每人4.38万元，“前途规划与名校申请夏令营(14天)”4.18万元，“苏格兰经典游学营(15天)”3.28万元。<br><br>
 如果国际修学游是学校组织、政府部门倡导的，家长和学生会更为放心地选择。那么，学校或者教育部门该不该成为高价国际游学的推手？<br><br>

    记者在网上查找各地学校的信息，发现一些中小学在本校网站上贴出的通知，出境游价格明显高出一般的旅行社。<br><br>
有家长告诉记者，学校的游学团或者到国外校际交流，一般情况下教师的费用都从学生所交费用中平摊，因此学生的费用高于旅游社的报价。<br><br>

    同时，记者发现，以省为单位的国际游学项目也已经在进行。<br><br>

    例如，江苏省教育国际交流服务中心(以下简称“苏教国际”)，这是目前全国规模最大的修学游组织机构之一。与其他商业机构不同，这是隶属于江苏省教育厅的直属事业单位。<br><br>

    在其网站上，有这样的介绍：修学旅行是苏教国际的传统项目，1997年开始至今已组织近2万名中小学生通过该项目赴英国、美国、澳大利亚等10余个国家短期学习。2008年策划并推出以“读万卷书、行万里路”为主题的“万名学子走世界”活动。<br><br>

    苏教国际推广的修学游报名方式是由学校负责审核后统一报各市教育部门，然后以市为单位向中心报名。学生家长张女士告诉记者：“虽然学校声称修学游自愿参加，可看着其他孩子报名，也想给自己的孩子报，怕孩子自卑。”  <br><br>
与海外游学旺盛的市场需求相比，沪上国内“游学”则路线相对单调，应者寥寥。进入暑假后，不少旅行社推出了针对青少年群体的国内游和夏令营项目。但是，很多国内“游学”夏令营，主要安排英语交流、拓展训练等内容，很少有主办方安排国内实地考察深度游，或者带领中小学生赴名高校走访考察等。<br><br>


一位旅行社工作人员称：“暑期游学本身就是舶来品，国外游学的历史长，众多教育机构和公益机构都参与。而在国内，无论是高校还是旅游景点，对青少年暑期游学的认知度不高，因此国内游学项目很难组织，对家长和孩子的吸引力也不大。”<br><br>

    家长汤女士带儿子去过日本、美国等地。她认为，在上海这样的大都市，很多家庭经济条件允许，当然首选海外游：“出国首先能锻炼孩子的英语能力，其次能让孩子实地体验国外的教育模式，为将来留学打基础。再次，日美等发达国家的国民素质高、现代化文明程度高，能够让孩子开拓视野、增长见识。”<br><br>

    在她看来，国内有不少传统文化胜地，由于过度商业包装而丧失了原有的文化魅力，“等孩子进入大学，大量阅读历史人文方面的书籍后再去实地考察也不迟”。 <br><br>
暑期“游学”何必舍近求远<br><br>

    随着暑假的临近，不少语言类培训机构和旅行社推出的“游学”项目，吸引了大批家长的咨询和报名。在某语言培训机构，负责接待的人员告诉记者，暑期欧美“游学团”早在放假前便已经基本额满。随后记者又咨询了几家旅行社和留学中介，发现很多商家都将“国际游学”“国际夏令营”作为暑期主打项目。这些项目中欧美线路最为热门。<br><br>

    与国外“游学”项目咨询报名火爆形成鲜明对比的是，不少相关机构推出的国内“游学”项目报名者寥寥。“国内项目我们已经做了三年，但无论是传统文化胜地还是大学游的效果都不好。”某旅行社负责人说。<br><br>

    本市某中学高二“国际班”学生宋子冉在去年的暑假曾跟着支教的表姐到甘肃农村当了一名“小志愿者”。虽然只有短短的一周时间，但是这段经历却深深地“烙”在了宋子冉的记忆中，“班上的不少同学都选择利用假期到国外看看，但是这段特殊经历却成为我最宝贵的精神财富。”<br><br>

    “‘游学’，不仅要体验当地的风土人情，更要‘游’与‘学’兼顾。家长在为孩子报名该项目时要从孩子的兴趣出发，切不可盲目跟风。其实国内也有不少地方适合孩子们的游览与学习，‘游学’不一定非要到国外或者很远的地方，了解世界，首先要了解‘国情’，可以从了解自己所在的城市开始。”天津一中校长李新建议。<br><br>

    对于暑期游学，多数上海家长“重海外轻国内”的观点，很多专家并不赞同。进才高中每年组织学生赴安徽大别山区学农，学生在农村吃住、与农民一同劳动，感受和了解中国农村的现实情况。校长王从连表示，学生不能只具有国际视野而缺乏对基本国情的认识。<br><br>

    复旦附中培养创新型人才的 “菁青计划”，也将国内游学列为重要一环――每年组织学生赴云南、贵州等中西部偏远山区考察。今年被清华大学录取的张琦琦透露，去年暑假赴贵阳的乌江复旦中学考察，第一次乘20多个小时火车、再乘汽车翻越两座山才到达，漫长的行程让她理解了中国“幅员辽阔”的含义。体验了当地的条件艰苦后，她才明白自己在上海物质条件优越，是“身在福中不知福”。<br><br>

游和学如何分配是难题：暑期课程逐渐兴起 <br><br>



2014-04-24 09:06　来源：北京晚报　 我有话说有10人参与<br><br>



 
　　虽然眼下距离暑假尚有两个多月的时间，但考虑到办理出国签证的时间，各大培训机构和留学中介的游学项目已经开始启动，甚至一些热门的游学路线名额已经告罄。<br><br>

　　“游”和“学”分配还看需求<br><br>

　　游学究竟是“游”还是“学”，到底怎样分配才能保证孩子这趟海外行收获颇多呢？<br><br>

　　专家告诉记者，游学是一项教育投资，并非简单的旅游消费。既不是单纯的旅游，也不是纯粹的留学，它在一段时间里贯穿了语言学习和参观游览，这两个如何搭配，就要看家长和同学的需要了。
<br><br>
　　虽然“学”很重要，但家长在选择游学项目时也不应过于追求学习的比例。游学不等同于培训，更重视对于综合素质的提高、国际视野的开阔。所以其中的“学”应是个广义的概念，不能狭义理解为课程，游学过程应该更注重孩子在团队意识、独立精神、与人打交道等方面的培养。新东方国际游学推广管理中心主任刘婷则告诉记者，游学作为2-3周的注重国际文化交流和体验性的活动，学生在游学中正是能够接触到点点滴滴、各式各样的信息和触动，从而才能有所成长和收获；所以如果一味地把学生困在一个又一个真实的课堂和死板的书本里，对于有些孩子来说，反而会起到相反的效果。<br><br>

　　海外暑期课程：升级版游学<br><br>

　　随着游学的新鲜感淡去和家长趋于理性化，越来越多的家长开始不满足于甚至怀疑游学的价值。游学往往主打的语言学习和名校游历，在家长眼中逐渐失去光彩。家长发现，短短半个月或者一个月的游学对于孩子的语言学习提高不大。另一方面，信息公开化和全球化，使得获取海外名校的招生信息不再成为难事。于是，一种新的游学形式―海外暑期课程开始走入人们的视野。<br><br>

　　相比游学，暑期课程更加原汁原味，能够为将来出国留学增加砝码。互联网游学平台米豆教育CEO曾懿仪告诉记者，一般游学项目是以旅游为主，学为辅，而暑期课程几乎没有旅游。在校期间，学生跟在国内上学没有什么区别，依然要去上课，要完成作业。游学一般都是国内的教育机构主办，没有名额限制，而暑期课程则由海外学校主办，包括中学和大学，名额较少，属于比较小众、高端的海外学习项目。
<br><br>
　　以美国大学的暑期课程为例，由于美国大学实行的“三学期制”，每年夏天都拥有长达两个半月的暑假。这期间，本科生可选读课程，积累学分。这类课程还为美国国内和海外高中生开放。很多美国和海外的优秀高中生，都会在暑假就读名校暑期课程。他们一般会选择美国本科大一的通识课，如高等数学、物理、化学、生物、艺术史、统计、经济学、会计等。高中生通过选修大学的这些课程，可获得学分。此类学分被美国各类大学认可，学生进入大学后可豁免再选修相应课程。由于课程是由大学教授授课，相当于高中生提前挑战大学学术要求，名校的学分课程更可为学生在申请大学时“加分”，突出他们的学术能力。<br><br>

　　与申请美国名校本科相比，申请美国名校的暑期课程难度相对较低，主要是对学生的语言能力有要求。如果学生想修读常青藤学校的暑期学分课程，一般要求托福达100分。如果是排名在美国二三十位左右大学的暑期课程，要求托福成绩在70分至90分。
<br><br>
　　美国大学的暑期课程一般从一周到七周不等，学费相比游学较贵。记者在米豆网上看到，为期四周的布朗大学环境保护和可持续发展项目，学费为7193美元。佩顿中学两周的夏令营学费也达到了7050美元。

出国游学，去不去？ <br><br>



2014-04-03  苏州日报<br><br>



    游学由来已久，孔子率弟子周游列国可算其始源。如今，这一传统的学习教育方式再次兴起，并日渐走俏。近年来，不少中小学生有组织地自费前往国外，学习语言课程、参观当地名校、入住当地学校或寄宿家庭、参观游览国外的主要城市和著名景点，学知识、开眼界。<br><br><br><br>

    游学是否真的能够寓学于游，带着这一思考，记者探访了苏州市中小学生的游学现状。
<br><br>
   热潮来袭 谁在游学？<br><br>

    苏州市游学粉丝占比约3‰，园区较为“扎堆”
<br><br>
    苏州市约有99万中小学生，根据记者联系到的游学组织统计估算，每年参加游学的中小学生人数大概在3000人以内，与在读生总人数相比，比例只有3‰。
<br><br>
    因为游学基本上都是出境项目，费用较高，最少的花费也要在万元以上，所以多是家境较为富裕的学生热衷参加。
<br><br>
    周老师是某教育部门组织过游学的工作人员，她向记者介绍说，从地域上看，苏州工业园区学校学生的游学活动最丰富，市区几所重点学校的游学粉丝也不少，生源以外来务工人员子弟为主的学校参加游学的人数基本为零。<br><br>

    “游学需要财力支持，参加学生的父母通常至少是白领以上阶层的人群。”周老师这样解释。<br><br>

    咋游咋学？<br><br>

    英语类游学最受欢迎，美国最热门<br><br>

    游学项目具体游些啥？又学些啥呢？记者根据采访到的信息大致归类如下：
<br><br>
    语言类游学是最常见的，其中英语游学最受欢迎。这类游学形式分为短期和长期：短期可以是赴游学目的地参加夏令营、竞赛、演出等，时间一般不超过一周，除了完成必须的任务，还有观光游玩的机会；　长期的语言类游学多是要求参与者完成一门课程，不同年级学生难易有所不同，最近园区学校有个赴加拿大修学的项目，最长时间三个月，学生在加拿大学校修学的课程学分可置换成母校的。还有一种语言类游学有在当地接待家庭住宿的安排，学生可通过与当地人一同生活的经历更好地训练口语。当然，以上几种形式也有交叉组合的情况。<br><br>

    专业类游学常见于年级较高的中学生参加，即去游学目的地学习特色的绘画、声乐、厨艺等。虽不以锻炼语言为主要目的，但掌握目的国的语言也是必要条件。此类游学项目的数量相对最少，如我市职业学校学生的赴外短期实训项目。
<br><br>
    还有一种是观光体验类的游学，在这种活动中，“游”占有绝对意义，比如美国名校巡礼、北京名校夏令营等。
<br><br>
    周老师介绍说，在游学目的地方面，美国、加拿大、英国、澳大利亚比较多见，亚洲的新加坡、韩国、日本也有不少项目，“亚洲国家虽然路途近、费用低，但总体来说，近年来最热门的还数美国的游学项目”。
<br><br>
    谁来组织？
<br><br>
    学校、教育机构、旅行社各走各的路
<br><br>
    游学项目在教育市场上日渐活跃，那么都是谁来组织的呢？记者采访了学校、民办教育机构和旅行社的相关工作人员。
<br><br>
    学校的游学项目多是通过官方的对外交流协会或政府部门等与境外学校建立起友好学校关系，学校选拔组织本校学生前往友好学校交流学习，多由带队老师跟随照料学生的起居、安全。游学课程有短期、长期之分，也包括竞赛、演出等项目。费用方面高低不等，少则一万元，多的也有超过五万元的。李妈妈同意孩子前往加拿大修学三个月，她认为，学校组织的活动可靠性高，比起校外的教育机构更放心些。
<br><br>
    英孚教育的海外游学项目在当下民办教育市场上颇受家长追捧。该机构面向8至17岁学生提供游学服务，参加的学生主要在游学目的国当地的英孚课程中心接受语言教学。苏州英孚教育的游学项目负责人戴伦告诉记者，他们组织的整个游学活动都是在英孚教育的体系内完成的，老师也是英孚自有的任课老师，游学期一般2―3周，学生上午上课，下午活动游戏。“我们的教学体系完整，会针对学生的语言水平进行分班教学，另外孩子可以通过游学项目认识不同的朋友”，戴伦说这或许是民办教育机构组织的
<br><br>
    游学项目的特色和长处。
<br><br>
    旅行社也有游学服务，苏州康辉旅行社的营销经理摩西接受采访时称，因为旅行社开展游学项目要通过目的地当地旅行社再与某些培训机构、学校对接，没有学校与学校之间直接对接那么方便，其中成本也高，所以近些年几乎不再承接散客的游学项目。不过，旅行社有个长处是可以为顾客“私人订制”游学项目，如果几十个学生组团或者家长陪同学生一起组团，该社可根据家长的具体要求设计细化的路线，提供个性化服务。
<br><br>
     开拓视野，适应国外生活，提高沟通技能
<br><br>
    姑苏区某实验小学的家长肖妈妈、任妈妈一致这么认为。两位都是全职妈妈，家庭经济状况优越，只要是有正向价值的游学项目，她们基本上都支持孩子参加。“可能是学校里家庭条件偏好的孩子比较多，假期的游学项目经常有名额不够用的现象。有些没能选拔上的孩子，甚至会要求家长带他们去游历与学校游学项目相同的路线。”她们这样说。
<br><br>
    小渔是园区第二实验小学六年级的学生，他去年参加了前往加拿大为期三个月的游学项目，今年暑假打算去美国。小渔的妈妈说，今后有把儿子送出国的打算，早点适应了解国外生活，游学是个很好的方式。
<br><br>
    方洲小学一年级的小媛今年只有7岁，但是寒假里已经参加过前往新加坡的竞赛游学项目，她告诉记者，妈妈并没有强勉她获得什么奖项，主要是希望她学会照顾自己，提高交际沟通能力。
<br><br>
    性价比不高，自理能力是挑战，易形成攀比风气
<br><br>
    市民徐先生的儿子在姑苏区某小学就读。今年，学校组织学生暑假去加拿大“游学”，为期两个月。儿子满心期待地提出想参加时，徐先生和妻子都选择了拒绝。对此，徐先生解释，不让儿子参加，倒不是因为钱。在他看来，学生参加这类交流活动，最大目的是提高英语水平，增加阅历。但两个月的时间里，儿子每天几乎都和老师同学待在一起，英语能力真的能有多大提高？
<br><br>
    李女士也持同样意见。她女儿正在市区某小学读六年级，去年底，学校组织了一次为期一周的新加坡游学，她和女儿一致决定不参加。在李女士看来，这类短期的游学项目课程太过简单，对提高女儿综合素质的帮助微乎其微。
<br><br>
    还有一点令徐先生担心的是，儿子一直生活在全家人的宠爱中，这样的交流活动固然会提高他的生活自理能力，但一下子转变太大，万一不适应，出现什么安全状况，才是最令人担心的。
<br><br>
    不过，不让儿子参加学校组织的游学，徐先生也有一些担忧。“他和小伙伴们早就约好了暑假一起去加拿大，结果就他一个人没参加。”儿子生气地告诉徐先生，这让他在朋友圈里很没面子。
<br><br>
    园区某小学的杨老师介绍，像徐先生这类孩子想参加家长不同意的现象不在少数。她告诉记者，自己班上一名学生报名参加了学校的游学项目，价格大约两三万元，但却遭到了家里的拒绝。家长认为价格过高，另外觉得这类交流项目对孩子的帮助不大。
<br><br>
    这位家长并未就此罢休。她认为，参不参加虽说全凭自愿，但一群学生中，有人去有人不去，很容易在学生中引起不平衡，会对学生的心理健康成长造成一定的影响。为此，她向教育主管部门投诉，希望能够采取措施刹住这股“游学风”。
<br><br>
    对于日渐兴起的游学热潮，苏州大学教育学教授赵蒙成认为，游学现象在东部发达地区的兴起，是伴随着居民收入逐渐增加这一大环境的。其次是家长对孩子的教育越来越重视。在不少家长看来，单纯的出国旅游，看一些景点，对孩子的成长帮助不大，他们更希望孩子能够深度体验国外的学习生活，而游学正好满足了他们这一需求。
<br><br>
    同时，赵蒙成认为，游学也是各所学校近年来尝试多元化办学的一种选择。
<br><br>
    相比以往的应试教育，现在的教学更注重学生的全面发展，而组织学生游学，和国外知名学校的学生一同上课、一同生活，除了语言能力得到提高之外，还能够帮助学生开阔视野、增加阅历，这对他们今后的成长都非常有帮助。“国内学生大多是独生子女，参加这种交流活动，也有助于提高他们的适应能力和生活自理能力。”赵蒙成说。
<br><br>
    不过，在赵蒙成看来，游学有利也有弊。
<br><br>
    如果这种游学是长期的，比如三个月、一学期甚至一年时间，学生的综合素质可以得到明显提升；但参加一些短期的交流项目，“如一个月或者只有十天半个月，则仍旧是浮光掠影式的走马观花，学生很难深入地体验感受国外学习生活，这和出国旅游差别不大。”
<br><br>
    另外，赵蒙成认为，国外的教育理念和教学内容和国内差别很大，去国外游学这段时间，也会耽误学校的学习课程，“学生参加交流回来之后，仍旧要恶补落下的课程才能跟得上其他同学的学习进度，否则，成绩出现滑坡在所难免。”
<br><br>
    随着交流团组人数迅速增加，组织管理不善、安全事故以及其他各种问题时有发生。
<br><br>
    为此，教育部、外交部、公安部和国家旅游局等四部门于2012年联合印发了《关于进一步加强对中小学生出国参加夏（冬）令营有关活动管理的通知》，对规范中小学生出国游学市场提出要求，其中涉及各地教育行政部门、学校、旅行社等相关机构的职责。
<br><br>
    今年年初，江苏省教育厅、省公安厅、省安全厅、省民政厅、省外办、省工商局、省旅游局等7部门联合印发了《关于进一步加强对中小学生境外修学旅行活动管理的通知》。
<br><br>
    3月31日，江苏省教育厅对该《通知》中涉及的修学旅行的教育内容所占比重、主办单位的界定、保证金的缴纳等事项作了详细解读。
<br><br>
    该《通知》要求游学活动不以营利为目的，其中教育内容所占比例一般不低于三分之二；　旅行活动的主办单位是中小学校、教育行政部门所属的对外教育交流机构、共青团、少先队或者妇联等，主办单位可以委托国家旅游局许可经营出境旅游业务的旅行社承办，但是主办单位必须为活动的第一责任人；　主办单位和承办单位需向其主管单位缴纳质量保证金140万元（中小学校作为主办单位时除外）；要为所有参团学生购买涵盖活动全程的医疗及意外险，每位学生保额不低于60万元。（记者　水木　小白）

游学成“疯”：暴利下的夏令营陷阱有多大？ 
<br><br>


2012-08-01  燕赵都市报　 <br><br>

 
     今年5月，教育部等四部委联合下发通知要求，不得以营利为目的组织出国夏(冬)令营，原则上不组织低年级学生出国参加夏(冬)令营等有关活动。然而记者走访北京、上海、南京( 酒店 )等城市发现，低龄化加剧、内容藏“猫腻”、学校逐暴利……游学团蜂拥海外背后，重重陷阱令人防不胜防。
<br><br>
    幼儿游学，游而不学？
<br><br>
    最近网上颇受关注的一组照片出自美国工作的网友Yrbbest之手：“在美国WOODBURYINFO CENTER的奥特莱斯购物街外，看见一群席地而坐的女孩子啃汉堡，上前一问才知道是北京一所小学的游学团。”
<br><br>
    记者采访多个游学团后发现，这并非个例。新东方今年暑假推出了近百条各类游学线路，其中一条收费38800元的线路，明确将“两晚入住赌城拉斯维加斯”列入行程，并安排“途经大型直营购物中心，可以采购世界名牌商品”。
<br><br>
    学生为什么游学？开阔眼界、学习英语、感受名校、体验文化，游学中介的回答让人眼前一亮。但记者调查发现，一些海外游学团异化为纯粹的旅游团、购物团，“游而不学”现象凸显。
<br><br>
    能从行程上一眼看出“问题”不少，隐藏“猫腻”更多。北京一位旅行业人士告诉记者，一些游学团宣称“安排国内的学生与当地学生一起上课”，但当地学校都已经放假了，谁还会跑到学校里上课？还有打着“名校游”推出的旅行团收费不低，但很多学校本来就没有围墙。
<br><br>
    游学团游而不学现象凸显，参与者日益低龄化更加剧了这一趋势。知名英语培训机构EF英孚教育打出口号“出国游学从小学生抓起”，还有机构甚至开发了幼儿园宝宝游学团。上海戴尔国际少儿英语为应对游学低龄化的市场需求，专门开设了访问美国幼儿园的游学线路，“美国加州幼儿园亲子夏令营”已于7月5日启程，参与者均是学龄前儿童。
<br><br>
    游学暴利，谁的“福利”？
<br><br>
    记者调查发现，学生海外游学团的行程与普通旅游团相似，很多只是增加了一些高校参观或与当地人士的交流活动，但价格往往要高出一两倍。此外，一些中小学校参与组织海外游学，借机敛财。“现在日本游普遍降价，但差不多行程的日本游学团，报价都在1.8万元以上，几乎是普通团的两倍。”一位江苏旅行社业内人士说，以目前游学项目中最热的美国游学团为例，旅行社报价一般在3万-5万元。如果是学校组织老师带队的，价格还要上浮1万元左右。
<br><br>
    一些游学团行程不透明，质量难保障。南京一名中学生称，出发前旅行社承诺“住宿环境优越”，但赴美游学期间住的是环境很差的地下室，投诉时旅行社还以“没有约定具体标准”为由推脱。
<br><br>
    一家大型旅行社的出境公司经理李青云说，游学团大多选择寒暑假出行，旅行中介一般提前半年以上预订往返机票，费用比普通团省30%以上。游学团大多选择当地家庭寄宿，费用也比酒店便宜不少。“吃住行等开支大头都比普通团便宜至少三分之一，但报价却反而高出近一倍，其中的利润不言而喻。”她说。
<br><br>
    记者调查发现，除了旅行社从海外游学产业中攫取暴利，少数学校和老师也参与其中，谋取好处。“很多学校热衷于组织游学团，几乎成了教师福利。七八个孩子均摊一个带队老师的费用。”南京师范大学教科院副教授殷飞说。
<br><br>
    游学无远近，可从身边起？
<br><br>
    南京市教研室副主任左坤表示，现代教育理念中，游学、修学的本意是让孩子接触社会，有的家长目的性强一些，希望增强孩子外语应用能力。“关键是一些游学掺杂了过多的商业利益，学生成了各方牟利的工具，亟待规范。”“与其到国外把名校当景点看，不如深入了解本地本国文化和社会。”殷飞表示，部分旅行机构将海外教育梦幻化，诱导家长盲目追逐海外游学，甚至引起了学生们的攀比之风。
<br><br>
    左坤等人建议，目前，教育部、国家旅游局等已经出台中小学海外游学的相关规定，当务之急，各地相关部门应遏制海外游学乱象。对于一些明显违反规定的旅游中介、学校和老师，应严格处罚。(新华社“新华视点”记者凌军辉、蒋芳)
